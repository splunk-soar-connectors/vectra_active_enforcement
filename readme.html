<html><head></head><body>Vectra Active Enforcement is designed to extract host information based on the following criteria:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>IP - Search for hosts based on addresses</li>
    <li>Tagging - Search for hosts based tags applied to the object in the UI</li>
    <li>Scoring - Search for hosts  that meet or exceed user-defined minimum threat and certainty scores</li>
    <li>Detections - Search for hosts that trigger detections based on user-defined detection categories and  types</li>
</ul>
<br>
It is important to note that Vectra Active Enforcement is built around a source-host centric view of the environment</body></html>
